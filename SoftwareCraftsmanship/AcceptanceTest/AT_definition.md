# Acceptance Test definition

Acceptance tests (an essential part of eXtreme Programming) are created from user stories. The customer specifies scenarios to test when a user story has been correctly implemented. A story can have one or many acceptance tests, what ever it takes to ensure the functionality works.
 
Acceptance tests are black box system tests. Each acceptance test represents some expected result from the system. 

Customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the acceptance tests and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. Acceptance tests are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. 

A user story is not considered complete until it has passed its acceptance tests.  

Acceptance tests should be automated so they can be run often. The acceptance test score is published to the team.
