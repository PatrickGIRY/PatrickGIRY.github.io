# BDD definition

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). BDD augments TDD and ATDD with the following tactics:

* Apply the **Five Why's** principle to each proposed user story, so that its purpose is clearly related to business outcomes.
* Thinking "from the outside in", in other words implement only those behaviors which contribute most directly to these business outcomes, so as to minimize waste
describe behaviors in a single notation which is directly accessible to domain experts, testers and developers, so as to improve communication.
* Apply these techniques all the way down to the lowest levels of abstraction of the software, paying particular attention to the distribution of behavior, so that evolution remains cheap.
* Concrete examples that describe expected behaviors reveal tricky details and hidden ambiguities.
* Having meaningful conversations during Specification Workshops between the domain experts, testers and developers is the most important, the rest is optional.
* Use nothing but plain business domain language that everyone understands.
* Describe the behavior, not the way it is implemented.
* BDD is about communication and behavior. It’s about exploring the unknown. It’s about sharing understanding.
